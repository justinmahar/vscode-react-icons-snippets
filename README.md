This extension supports:

- 🙌 All `react-bootstrap` components. The complete picture.

## 📖 Snippets

**All snippets start with `rb` for React-Bootstrap.**

There are 386 snippets available for components, imports, and examples. Read more on each below.

### Component Snippets

All of React-Bootstrap's components are supported.

For example, `rb:alert`, `rb:badge`, `rb:breadcrumb`, etc.

Where applicable, suggestions are made for which components to use inside a given component, such as `thead` and `tbody` inside a `Table`.

### Import Snippets

Component import snippets are available for all React-Bootstrap components. 

All imports begin with `rb:import` followed by the component name. For example, `rb:import:row` will import `Row`. 

Since it's such a common use case, you can also use `rb:import:grid` to import `Container`, `Row`, and `Col` all at once.

### Example Snippets

Where applicable, examples from the docs are provided as snippets. These can be very helpful as a starting point when working with more complex components, or for use as quick placeholders.

Example snippets all end with `-example`. 

For instance, `rb:alert-example` will insert an example `Alert` to build upon.

### Alert and Modal Functions

For convenience, function snippets are included for the show/hide functions needed for modals and dismissible alerts.

Use `rb:modal-functions` for the following:

```tsx
const [showModal, setShowModal] = React.useState(false);
const handleCloseModal = () => setShowModal(false);
const handleShowModal = () => setShowModal(true);
```

And `rb:alert-dismissible-functions` for the following:

```tsx
const [showAlert, setShowAlert] = React.useState(false);
const handleCloseAlert = () => setShowAlert(false);
const handleShowAlert = () => setShowAlert(true);
```

These pair nicely with the snippets for `rb:modal` and `rb:alert-dismissible`.

### Table Utilities

This extension includes utilities for tables so you can quickly build table headers and table rows.

Use `rb:table-row-X` and `rb:table-header-row-X`, where `X` is the number of columns from 2-9, to quickly build rows in your `thead` and `tbody`.
